The Zwicky Transient Facility has been extremely successful in discovering new TDEs (>60 over the duration of ZTF-I and ZTF-II; see figure to the left for the ZTF-I sample). As we grow our sample of observed TDEs, we can begin to do population studies of these transients. One of the most important questions surrounding TDEs and their light curves is whether or not we can use them to measure the masses of the black holes at the centers of these events. In theory, the mass of the black hole should be imprinted in some way on the light curve and by characterizing these light curves (e.g., through timescales), we can begin to understand whether our theoretical predictions are true. I have done extensive work on studying the light curves of the ZTF sample of TDEs. See <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...942....9H/abstract" target="_blank">here</a> for more!

TDE host galaxies are a puzzling population. Studies have shown that the majority of them are "green" in color, i.e. they live in a place on a color-mass diagram called the green valley (see to the right) between blue, star-forming galaxies and red, quiescent galaxies, where only ~13% of the general galaxy population resides. TDE host galaxies become even more puzzling when looking at their morphologies. Studies have also shown that they are generally more centrally concentrated than other galaxies of the same mass and the same color. Post-starburst, or E+A galaxies, are also overrepresented among TDE host galaxy populations. E+As are rare, comprising less than a few percent of the general galaxy population and yet they consistently host TDEs. All of these characteristics must somehow increase the TDE rates in these galaxies and my research focuses on figuring out why and how.

      The summer of my sophomore year as an undergraduate, I was part of a four-member research group that worked
      under Professor Eilat Glikman’s guidance on evaluating and utilizing new selection criteria for dust-reddened
      quasars. We considered sources with high luminosities in the near-infrared region (K&lt15.1, 2 μm)
      in an equatorial stripe of sky (SDSS Stripe 82) that had been missed by the SDSS’s selection algorithm.
      We characterized objects using BPT diagrams which separate out the nature of the photoionizing source. As a result,
      our sample of low-redshift, luminous, and obscured quasars provide an excellent set for follow-up observations with high-resolution
      instruments, with the goal of offering evidence of mergers and probing into early evolutionary phases of a galaxy.
      The results of this work have been published <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...861...37G/abstract">here</a>.
      <br><br>
      As a part of my undergraduate senior thesis, I conducted research in post-merger galaxy dynamics.
      I analyzed data from the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph (Keck) combined with Laser Guide-Star
      Adaptive Optics (LGS) to better understand the evolution of moderately dust-reddened quasars as
      well as their hosting galaxies. My two-part undergraduate thesis may be found here:<a href="704_MCrnogorcevic.pdf"> Part I</a> and <a href="705_MCrnogorcevic.pdf">Part II</a>.

Under the guidance of Professor Noah Graham, I carried out research concerning the edge
expansion for scalar Casimir energies. Presented with electromagnetic results for a configuration
consisting of an oblate spheroid facing a perfectly conducting plane, I proposed a less computationally
expensive analysis of the Casimir force using a scalar field theory. This approach required modifications
and improvements of the existing code written in C that
computes spheroidal functions. I presented this project at the Middlebury Summer Symposium in 2016, poster with details can be found <a href="Casimir_poster.pdf"> here.</a>

<!-- <h9 class="post-page-title "><span style="color: #2471A3; font-size:16px"><i>(bonus) How did I choose my research...and why?</i></span></h9>
<p style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:15px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px">
  The decision to attend a liberal arts institution (Middlebury College) followed from my desire to obtain a well-rounded
  education that allows for a direct exposure to and learning from critical thinkers within different
  academic disciplines, making me a more inquisitive and creative scientist. My research interests during the undergraduate
  years were two-fold: I studied physics on very small scales, specifically
  the attraction forces between two plates due to quantum fluctuations
  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect">Casimir effect</a>);
   and physics on large scales, by studying the co-evolution of galaxies
  and supermassive black holes at their centers. Coming to graduate school,
  I decided to further explore these two interests and combine them through my current
  research in dark matter and high-energy astroparticle physics. My primary graduate school goal is similar to my
  undergraduate one: I want to be a well-rounded astrophysicist, continuously enhancing my literacy in a wide range of topics. As such,
  while I am developing a strong expertise in the field of astrophysical searches for ALPs, I am also
  intentional in exposing myself to different analysis methods and topics (e.g. multimessenger analysis with neutrinos and
  gravitational waves, stellar evolution, magnetic-field modeling, subthreshold searches, instrumentation, etc.) I also thoroughly enjoy
  being in classes--both as a student and an instructor--and love learning about the Universe from different perspectives and at different scales
  (my dream job would be taking classes for the rest of my life. And, some exposure time to an unknown topic, the chances are I'll get interested!)
